Meta-level Reflections

okay it's been a while since I've made a large-scale CS project  
i just re-realized the importance of pseudocode  
i don't like how i'm tackling it rn â€“ gonna start from fresh and write out pseudocode for everything, before connecting it all up  


meta notes on writing big programs. 
questions to ask, while designing
    who is gonna call me? what's the specific context i'll have access to?

okay, rederiving the formulas will actually make me cry. 
so i'm simply not gonna do that
in the interests of time, and atharva's emotional well-being, i'll directly take the formulas from the exisiting copycat implementation
